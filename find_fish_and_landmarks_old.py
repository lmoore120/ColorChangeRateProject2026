find_fish_and_landmarks.py
------------------------------------
Finds the fish in an image or video frame (as the largest blob that looks
different from the background), samples the background color in a ring
immediately surrounding it, and then AUTOMATICALLY PLACES THE 43 LANDMARKS
that the ImageJ protocol asks you to place by hand - plus the scale bar
measurement and the 6 colour-standard points.

This is the original find_fish_and_local_background.py with the landmarking
workflow built on top. Everything the original script did, it still does.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT WAS ALREADY HERE (unchanged)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Handles the "lightbox" vignette: depending on camera position/zoom, the
video sometimes shows the circular edge of the lightbox around the tank,
with everything outside that circle being irrelevant (dark table, room,
etc. - not part of the actual experiment). When that circle is visible,
this detects it and restricts ALL analysis (background color, fish
detection) to inside it. When no circle is visible (camera zoomed in
tighter), it just uses the whole frame - no assumption either way is
hard-coded, it's detected per frame.

  1. Tries to find a circular edge (the lightbox boundary) in the frame.
  2. Figures out the background color (white or black) by looking at the
     most common brightness WITHIN the relevant area.
  3. Finds every blob of pixels that looks meaningfully different from
     that background.
  4. Ignores blobs touching the very edge of the relevant area.
  5. Picks the single largest remaining blob and calls that the fish.
  6. Draws a ring a set distance around the fish's outline and samples
     the color WITHIN that ring (excluding the fish itself).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS NEW - THE IMAGEJ PROTOCOL, AUTOMATED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step (b)/(c) - scale bar:
     Looks for a long thin solid bar (the 10 mm scale bar) in the image,
     measures its length in pixels, and writes that number into the
     results spreadsheet - this is the number the protocol tells you to
     paste into the 5th column of Excel. Also converts it to px/mm.
     If auto-detection is wrong or misses, you can click the two ends
     yourself, or pass --scale-px if you already know the number.

Step (d) - the 43 fish landmarks:
     The fish outline found in step 5 above is resampled into a smooth,
     evenly-spaced closed curve. The 7 FIXED landmarks are then found
     from the shape itself:
         1. Anterior            - the tip of the snout (the far end of
                                  the long body axis, away from the tail)
         2. Anterior dorsal fin - the front notch where the dorsal fin
                                  meets the back (a concave corner)
         3. Posterior dorsal fin- the rear notch of the dorsal fin
         4. Dorsal caudal fin   - the upper corner of the tail fin
         5. Ventral caudal fin  - the lower corner of the tail fin
         6. Posterior anal fin  - the rear notch of the anal fin
         7. Anterior anal fin   - the front notch of the anal fin
     The remaining 36 are then placed as equally-spaced SEMILANDMARKS
     along the outline between consecutive fixed landmarks, in exactly
     the counts the protocol specifies:
         1 -> 2 : landmarks 8-16   (9 points)
         2 -> 3 : landmark  17     (1 point)
         3 -> 4 : landmarks 18-19  (2 points)
         4 -> 5 : landmarks 20-28  (9 points)
         5 -> 6 : landmark  29     (1 point)
         6 -> 7 : landmarks 30-32  (3 points)
         7 -> 1 : landmarks 33-43  (11 points)
     Total: 7 + 36 = 43, numbered and ordered the same way you would
     have clicked them with the multi-point tool.

Step (e) - the 6 colour-standard landmarks:
     Finds the red, green and blue patches by colour, fits a line through
     them, and extrapolates back along that line to the mid grey, light
     grey and white patches (this assumes the 6 patches are in a straight
     evenly-spaced row, which is how colour standards are printed). They
     come out in protocol order: white, light grey, mid grey, red, green,
     blue - i.e. points 44-49 if you think of them as continuing the same
     multi-point series. The actual measured colour of each patch is also
     written to the spreadsheet so you can colour-correct with it later.
     If auto-detection fails you can click the 6 patches yourself, and
     with --colour-standard-from-first you only have to do it once for a
     whole folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Automatic placement of fin-insertion landmarks is a genuinely hard problem
and this WILL get some frames wrong - a torn fin, an overlapping pectoral
fin, a fish curled towards the camera, or a fin held flat against the body
can all move a notch or hide it. Treat the output as a first pass, not as
finished data.

That is what the built-in review window is for. Unless you pass
--no-review, each image opens in a window where you can drag any landmark
to where it belongs before it is saved. Landmark 1 is always the snout,
so if the whole ring looks rotated, fix landmark 1 first and press R to
re-flow the semilandmarks around it.
